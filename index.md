## **About**

I'm a researcher and engineer focused on turning research ideas into products, especially where AI and crypto meet. 

As a founding researcher at MyShell AI and PIN AI, I am passionate about building community-owned AI that fairly distributes value back to its users. 

I received my PhD in Computer Science from MIT and my Bachelor's in Physics from UC Berkeley.

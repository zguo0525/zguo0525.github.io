## **Research and Product**

I am a researcher and developer with a Ph.D. in data-efficient machine learning from MIT, focusing on foundation models, multi-modal models, and AI/agent applications.

Before MIT, I earned a B.A. in Physics and English from UC Berkeley. I've founded a few startups and a venture DAO, driven by the desire to push the boundaries of what's possible and to create lasting impact with elegant solutions.

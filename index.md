## **Product Research**

I am a product-driven researcher with a Ph.D. from MIT CSAIL, where I turn fundamental research into real-world applications. 

My background in Physics and English from UC Berkeley provides a unique lens for this work. Physics trained me to think from first principles; English taught me to craft the narratives that turn technology into products. This is the foundation for how I build and advise companies in **AI and Web3**.

## **Opportunities**

I partner with founders and investors to solve hard problems grounded in fundamental research. If that resonates, let's connect on [X](https://twitter.com/Zhen4good) or [email me](mailto:zguo0525@mit.edu).

## Pride Can Hold You Back: Lessons from My Time at Berkeley and MIT

Every builder has a playbook. But a playbook is useless without the right mindset, and the most dangerous trap for any builder is pride. It makes you feel like you've already won, when the game is just getting started.

I learned this the hard way. My story starts at UC Berkeley, where I was all in on my majors, Physics and Englishâ€”subjects I loved. But as graduation neared, the AI boom was hard to ignore. For what I thought were practical reasons, I pivoted to computer science for grad school. A big part of that decision, however, was pride. I was proud of making a "strategic" choice, even if it meant leaving behind something I was passionate about.

Getting into MIT for my PhD felt like the ultimate validation. It was easy to get swept up in the prestige and think I had "made it." But that pride quickly turned into complacency. I stopped being hungry for what was next.

That was a huge mistake. The moment you think you've "made it" is the moment you start falling behind.

That experience at MIT was a necessary wake-up call. It taught me that if you let pride take the wheel, you're heading straight for stagnation. So this is the first rule of my playbook: stay hungry. You can have the best strategy in the world, but if your mindset is stuck on yesterday's wins, you've already lost.

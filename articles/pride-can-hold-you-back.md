## Pride Can Hold You Back: Lessons from My Time at Berkeley and MIT

Let's talk about pride. It's a funny thing, right? It can give you a major confidence boost, making you feel like you've got it all figured out. But I've learned the hard way that it can also be a trap, closing you off to what's next.

My story starts back at UC Berkeley. I was all in on my majors, Physics and Englishâ€”subjects I absolutely loved. But as graduation got closer, the real world started knocking. The AI boom was happening, and everyone was talking about job security. So, I made a pivot. I jumped into computer science for grad school.

On the surface, it seemed like a smart, practical decision. A solid career path, especially in the pricey Bay Area. I told myself it was the right call, but a big part of that was just pride. I was proud of being able to make a "strategic" choice, even if it meant giving up what I was passionate about.

Getting into MIT for my PhD felt like I'd won. I mean, it's MIT. The prestige, the smart people... it was easy to get swept up in it. I was proud of where I was, and for a while, that was enough. But then, something shifted. That pride turned into comfort, and comfort turned into complacency. I stopped being hungry. I figured I had "made it."

Big mistake. The moment you think you've made it is the exact moment you start to coast, and coasting is just a slow way of falling behind.

That experience at MIT was a wake-up call. It taught me that if you let pride take the wheel, you're heading straight for stagnation. So here's what I took away from it all: don't get so hung up on what you've already done that you forget to keep growing. The world doesn't stop moving, and neither should you. That's the real secret to staying in the game and actually enjoying it.

# Inside Apple Intelligence: What I Learned During the Siri AI Makeover

*June 2025*

When I saw the new Siri demoed on stage, I knew the teams were in for a challenge. The demo was brilliant, but from my perspective, the engineering reality was far more complex. [A recent article from *The Information*](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-fumbled-siris-ai-makeover) captured the dysfunction that followed, but it missed the deeper lesson: even the world's most valuable company stumbles when brilliant people work in misaligned systems.

## The Anatomy of an AI Failure

Siri's struggles were the most visible symptom, but the quiet failure of notification summaries was more telling. The feature, designed to condense alerts, became a case study in how AI goes wrong.

The public examples were almost comical—an AI turning a polite request into a blunt command or misreading a simple group chat message. The lesson wasn't just that the tech was unreliable; it was that the models lacked social context. This points to a fundamental tension in AI development, highlighted by the "Mini Mouse and Mighty Mouse" approaches in the reporting. To work well, AI needs data and context from the cloud. But to be private, as Apple promises, it must run on-device.

The breaking point was when Apple disabled the feature for news apps after media outlets like the BBC raised concerns. To me, this was the critical moment. It showed how quickly technical errors become a much bigger problem: the erosion of public trust. These failures illustrate the gap between what language models can do (process text) and what users need (understand meaning).

## The Human Element

But these technical challenges weren't the most surprising part; the real insight is organizational. The reported tension between Craig Federighi's software engineering group and John Giannandrea's AI team highlights a classic problem: how to integrate a research-oriented AI division with a product-driven engineering organization.

It's a clash of cultures. One is built for shipping products on a deadline; the other is designed for exploration. The "AIMLess" nickname mentioned in the article points to this friction. It's what happens when the iterative process of research is judged by the linear standards of product development.

## What This Means for AI

Apple's Siri struggles reveal a truth about the next phase of AI: the winners won't be those with the best models, but those with the best product integration.

While it's often easier to build a product from scratch, as OpenAI did with ChatGPT, Apple faces a much different challenge: making Siri smarter for a billion users without breaking the features they already rely on. Refactoring a legacy system at that scale is a monumental task.

The decision to put Craig Federighi in charge of Siri makes sense. His software engineering team has the execution muscle to ship AI features at Apple scale. But the deeper question remains: can Apple maintain its privacy principles while competing in an AI world that rewards data collection?

## Lessons for Builders

Three lessons from watching this unfold:

**First, simple-seeming AI features are often the hardest.** Notification summaries looked trivial but required understanding context and tone that our models couldn't handle reliably.

**Second, organizational design is product design.** The tension between teams wasn't just politics; it was a structural impediment to shipping great AI products. You can't build the future with yesterday's org chart.

**Third, privacy isn't just a marketing message; it's an engineering constraint.** On-device processing makes everything harder, but constraints breed creativity. Respecting privacy is a lasting advantage.

## Looking Forward

Apple will eventually ship great AI. The talent, resources, and focus are there. But the delay is a reminder that even Apple isn't immune to the challenges of transformational tech.

The real question isn't if Apple can catch up to its competitors, but whether it can build AI that feels distinctly Apple—private, intuitive, and seamlessly integrated.

It's a harder problem, but it's the only one that will keep Apple from becoming a beautiful hardware company powered by someone else's intelligence.

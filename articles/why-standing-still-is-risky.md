## Why Standing Still Is the Riskiest Move in a Changing World

A playbook for building in tech has to be dynamic. The biggest strategic mistake is assuming yesterday's rules will apply to today's game. When ChatGPT dropped in 2023, it was a signal that the game was changing for everyone.

It lit a fire under me. I hustled and got back to the Bay Area, but when I arrived, I noticed something strange: many people in tech were acting like nothing had changed. They were still holding onto old methods, proud of their job titles and the skills that had gotten them there.

Pride in your work is essential, but it becomes a liability when the ground is shaking beneath your feet. Tools like ChatGPT aren't just a fad; they are fundamentally changing how we build. The game is evolving.

Yet I saw brilliant people grinding away on problems that were quickly becoming obsolete. It was like watching someone perfect the art of building a horse-drawn carriage while the first cars were rolling off the assembly line.

When you're too proud of where you are, you stop looking at the road ahead. You get comfortable. In a world that moves as fast as ours, standing still is the riskiest move you can make. That perceived security is an illusion when you're blind to the massive changes on the horizon.

This is the strategic core of my playbook: adapt or get left behind. The most valuable skill isn't mastering one tool, but recognizing when the entire toolbox is about to change. You can't win the next game by perfecting your strategy for the last one. The next wave is always coming, and you have to be ready to ride it.

## Why Standing Still Is the Riskiest Move in a Changing World

*The world changed in 2023 when ChatGPT came out. For me, it wasn’t just another piece of technology—it was revolutionary. This was a tool that had the potential to reshape entire industries and improve the way we work, think, and interact with technology. For the first time in a long while, I felt the fire to be part of something that could transform the future.*

At that time, I felt like nobody. I wasn’t a leading figure in the field, and compared to others, I was just a small player. But that didn’t matter to me. I knew I wanted to contribute to this revolution. So, I hustled. I worked hard to build my knowledge and skills, and after years of effort, I found myself back in the Bay Area.

But what struck me most after returning was how many people in the industry were still stuck in the past. Despite all the changes happening around us—despite the transformative power of tools like ChatGPT—so many people were clinging to the old ways of doing things. Engineers and programmers still took immense pride in their code, their jobs, and their roles in tech giants like Google, Meta, or Apple. They were confident in their skills, secure in their routines, and proud of what they had built.

I get it—pride in your work is natural. It feels good to be part of something established, something that you’ve contributed to. But what I realized was that pride can be dangerous, especially when the world around you is changing so fast.

AI, large language models, and code generation tools are advancing rapidly. ChatGPT wasn’t just an anomaly; it was a signal that the landscape of work was about to shift dramatically. Yet, so many people were still focused on perfecting their traditional skills—writing “elegant” code, solving complex LeetCode problems, and mastering the old ways of doing things. What they didn’t see was that the future was already here, and that their jobs were at risk of being disrupted.

The problem is, when you’re too proud of where you are, you fail to see what’s coming. You convince yourself that your current skills and achievements are enough to carry you forward. But in a world that’s constantly evolving, standing still is the greatest risk of all.

What worries me most is that many people in the industry don’t seem concerned. They think their jobs are secure because their companies are strong, their roles are well-defined, and they’ve been successful so far. But pride in what you’ve done can blind you to the changes happening around you.

In a rapidly changing world, the only way to stay relevant is to keep looking ahead. You have to adapt, to see the bigger picture, and to be willing to embrace new ways of thinking and working. The moment you stop learning, the moment you stop growing, you risk falling behind.

The lesson I’ve learned is this: pride in your current achievements might feel good for a moment, but it’s dangerous in a world of constant change. Don’t let it blind you to the future. Embrace the changes that are coming, because they’re coming faster than you think. And if you don’t move with the world, you’ll find yourself left behind.

## Why Standing Still Is the Riskiest Move in a Changing World

Remember when ChatGPT dropped in 2023? It felt like the world shifted overnight. For me, it wasn't just cool tech; it was a sign of a massive wave of change coming, and I knew I wanted to ride it. It lit a fire under me to get back in the game and help build what was next.

Honestly, I felt like a nobody at the time. But I didn't care. I put my head down, hustled hard, and eventually made my way back to the Bay Area. But when I got here, I noticed something strange. A lot of people in tech were acting like nothing had changed. They were still holding onto the old ways, proud of their code, their job titles at big-name companies, and the skills that got them there.

Look, I get it. Being proud of your work is a good thing. But that pride becomes a liability when the ground is shaking beneath your feet. Tools like ChatGPT aren't just a fad; they're fundamentally changing how we work. The game is evolving.

And yet, I saw so many smart people still grinding away on LeetCode problems and perfecting skills that were quickly becoming obsolete. It's like they were perfecting the art of building horse-drawn carriages while the first cars were rolling off the assembly line.

Here's the danger: when you're too proud of where you are, you stop looking at the road ahead. You get comfortable. You think what got you *here* will get you *there*. In a world that moves as fast as ours, standing still is the riskiest thing you can do.

What really gets me is how few people seem worried. They're comfortable in their secure jobs, thinking they're safe. But that security is an illusion when you're blind to the massive changes happening all around you.

So, what's the takeaway? You have to stay hungry. You have to keep learning and be willing to adapt. Don't let your past wins make you complacent about the future. The next wave is coming, and it's coming fast. You either learn to surf, or you get left behind.

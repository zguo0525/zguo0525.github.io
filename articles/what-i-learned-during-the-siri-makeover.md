# What I Learned During the Siri Makeover

*July 2025*

When I saw the new Siri demoed on stage, I knew the teams were in for a challenge. The demo was brilliant, but from my perspective, the engineering reality was far more complex. [A recent article from *The Information*](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-fumbled-siris-ai-makeover) captured some of the challenges, but it missed the deeper lesson: even the world's most valuable company faces hurdles when brilliant people work in evolving systems.

## The Anatomy of an AI Challenge

Siri's new capabilities were the most visible, but the quiet challenge of notification summaries was more instructive. The feature, designed to condense alerts, became a case study in how AI development unfolds.

The public examples were often surprisingâ€”an AI turning a polite request into a blunt command or misreading a simple group chat message. The lesson wasn't just that the tech was still maturing; it was that the models lacked social context. This points to a fundamental tension in AI development, highlighted by the "Mini Mouse and Mighty Mouse" approaches in the reporting. To work well, AI needs data and context from the cloud. But to be private, it must run on-device.

The learning curve became clear when the feature was adjusted for news apps after media outlets like the BBC raised concerns. To me, this was a critical moment. It showed how quickly technical hurdles become a much bigger opportunity: building public trust. These instances illustrate the gap between what language models can do (process text) and what users need (understand meaning).

## The Human Element

But these technical challenges weren't the most surprising part; the real insight is organizational. The reported discussion between software engineering and AI teams highlights a classic problem: how to integrate a research-oriented AI division with a product-driven engineering organization.

It's a meeting of different cultures. One is built for shipping products on a deadline; the other is designed for exploration. This dynamic is common when the iterative process of research is judged by the linear standards of product development.

## What This Means for AI

Apple's Siri experience reveals a truth about the next phase of AI: the winners won't be those with the best models, but those with the best product integration.

While it's often easier to build a product from scratch, as OpenAI did with ChatGPT, Apple faces a much different challenge: making Siri smarter for a billion users without breaking the features they already rely on. Refactoring a legacy system at that scale is a monumental task.

## Lessons for Builders

Three lessons from watching this unfold:

**First, simple-seeming AI features are often the hardest.** Notification summaries looked trivial but required understanding context and tone that AI models couldn't handle reliably.

**Second, organizational design is product design.** The alignment between teams is a structural component of shipping great AI products. You can't build the future with yesterday's org chart.

**Third, privacy isn't just a marketing message; it's an engineering constraint.** On-device processing makes everything harder, but constraints breed creativity. Respecting privacy is a lasting advantage.
